.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program fetches mail from a POP3 server or from
.Em stdin
and delivers it based on a ruleset in the configuration file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-f conffileXXX"
.It Fl a Ar name
Process only the specified account. This option may appear multiple times. The account name may include shell glob characters to match multiple accounts.
.Pp
.It Fl f Ar conffile
Specify the configuration file location. Default is
.Pa ~/fdm.conf ,
or
.Pa /etc/fdm.conf
if it doesn't exist.
.Pp
.It Fl l
Log using
.Xr syslog 3
rather than to
.Em stderr .
.Pp
.It Fl n
Do not process any accounts, just verify the configuration file syntax and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl u Ar user
Specify the default user for delivery. This overrides the
.Ic default-user
option in the configuration file.
.Pp
.It Fl v
Request verbose logging. This option may be specified multiple times.
.Pp
.It Fl x Ar name
Exclude the named account. Multiple
.Fl x
options may be specified. As with
.Fl a ,
shell glob characters may be used.
.Pp
.It Ar fetch | poll
The
.Ar fetch
command instructs
.Nm
to fetch and deliver messages. The
.Ar poll
command polls the accounts in the configuration file and reports a message count for each.
.Pp
.El
.Sh LOCAL MAIL WITH SENDMAIL
.Nm
can be used to deliver local mail from
.Xr sendmail 8
by making use of .forward files. An account fetching mail from
.Em stdin
should be specified in the user's
.Pa ~/.fdm.conf
file,
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
account "stdinacct" stdin
.Ed
.Pp
and the user's
.Pa ~/.forward
file should be set to contain something like (including quotation marks):
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
"|/usr/local/bin/fdm -l -a stdinacct fetch"
.Ed
.Pp
.Xr sendmail 8
will then invoke
.Nm
to deliver mail and
.Nm
will pass it through any filtering rules as normal.
