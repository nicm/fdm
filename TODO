- SMTP AUTH, SSL and/or TLS
- auth on http proxying
- http (hotmail) fetching
- redo chrooting properly (resolver needs to be in parent)
- finish regression tests
	rules
	% tokens
	maildir
- extend POP3/IMAP tests:
	new-only/old-only
	oversize mails
- balance man pages/manual
- match attachment expressions:
	match attachment (index > 1 and size < 200 and type "fnmatch")
- attach get name from content-disposition
- more attachment stuff: remove-attachment, write-/pipe-attachment etc
- refactor & clean up privsep mail transfer code
- is there any reason struct mail shouldn't point to a struct account?
- cumulative effect of a compound action sucks
- better website
- fetch from compressed mbox: have to change fetch-mbox to not use mmap
- all timeouts should be in seconds or milliseconds, decide which and make it so
- use TOP to grab only header and return to get body only if actually necessary
- automatically delete old mail on server once it reaches a certain age...
  does this break the barrier of what fdm is designed for?
- does imap need a to-fetch list a la pop3? having mails marked read that have
  not been successfully delivered is still a problem though. how can this be
  fixed?
- string match as regexp, attachment as fnmatch sucks
- common comparison code? num/str
- pop3 over pipe lack of .netrc sucks
- generic flags on account so that no-verify/no-apop don't have to be in the
  right order also fix man page
- NNTP should warn if mail is dropped - generic flag
- make-style filtering for tags :S/// etc
- docs from Thomas@BIC:
	clarify that first match stops without continue
	shell commands: when evaluated (done?)
	from-headers examples, lengthen discussion
	clarify keep for NNTP (done?)
	clarify action tag use/updating, and wrt lambda actions
	man page: "The name of the last action executed for this mail."
		(last or current?)
	attach size units (same as maximum-size)
	case sensitivity
	mention short-circuit evaluation
	check pipe command user
- when doing .netrc lookup, match the username if given as well to allow
  multiple users on the same server
- set secondary groups when changing user
- from-headers stuff can probably go at some point
- regress fails as root
- rml could be stored as actual tags, then command0-9 could go... means
  copying... get rid of %0
- add FAQ entry about no-apop since there are several servers out there
  which claim to support it but do not
- option to relax group ownership checks to permit secondary groups,
  for shared mailboxes
