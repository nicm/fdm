fdm is a small program designed to fetch mail from POP3 servers, or receive
local mail from stdin, and deliver it in various ways. It is meant at present
to be a single, reasonably easily configured solution for single users (I
originally wrote it to replace the horrible setup with fetchmail and procmail I
was using at home). There are a few nods in the direction of multiuser setups
but isn't really enough and I will probably either change it or take it out
once I've made a decision about whether trying to do both is a bad idea. It may
work (if a bit clunkily since it can't guess the destination user from the
headers so they would all need to be specified in the config file) but I don't
really recommend using the current version for this.

To run fdm from cron every half hour, I use:

*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/fdm -l -x stdin fetch

(My stdin account is called, well, "stdin".)

Check out the fdm.conf(5) man page and the included fdm.conf file for config
file syntax.

For details of using it with sendmail(8) and .forward files, see the fdm(1) man
page. Users of other MTAs are on their own. Man page diffs and/or instructions
I can format into the man page would be appreciated.

This is beta-quality software. There will be bugs. I use maildirs so they are
the most tested.

Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc, are welcome.

I usually prefer to use the address below but with their customary efficiency
SF.net seem to be only permitting some mail to actually get through (or they
changed something and didn't tell us), so I can also be reached at:
