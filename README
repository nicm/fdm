fdm is a small program designed to fetch mail POP3 servers, or local mail from
stdin, and deliver it in various ways. It is meant at present to be a single,
reasonably easily configured solution for single users (I originally wrote it
to replace the horrible setup with fetchmail and procmail I was using at
home). There are a few nods in the direction of multiuser setups but isn't
really enough and I will probably either change it or take it out once I've 
made a decision about whether trying to do both is a bad idea. It may work
(if a bit clunkily since it can't guess the destination user from the headers
so they would all need to be specified in the config file) but I don't really
recommend using the current version for this.

To run fdm from cron every half hour, I use:

*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/fdm -l -x stdin fetch

Check out the fdm.conf(5) man page and the included fdm.conf file for config
file syntax.

For details of using it with sendmail(8) and .forward files, see the fdm(1) man
page. Users of other MTAs are on their own. Man page diffs and/or instructions
I can format into the man page would be appreciated.

This is beta-quality software. There will be bugs. I use maildirs so they are
the most tested.

Feedback, bug reports, suggestions, etc, are welcome.
