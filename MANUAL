Introduction ===================================================================

fdm is a program to fetch mail and deliver it in various ways depending on as
user-supplied ruleset. Mail may be fetched from stdin, IMAP or POP3 servers, or
from local maildirs, and filtered based on whether it matches a regexp, its
size or age, or the output of a shell command. It can be rewritten by an
external process, dropped, left on the server or delivered into maildirs,
mboxes, to a file or pipe, or any combination.

fdm is designed to be lightweight but powerful, with a compact but clear
configuration syntax. It is primarily designed for single-user uses but may
also be configured to deliver mail in a multi-user setup. In this case, it uses
privilege seperation to minimise the amount of code running as the root user.

Installation ===================================================================

Installing fdm is simple. Download the source tarball, and run:

$ tar -zxvf fdm-?.?.tar.gz
$ cd fdm-?.?.tar.gz
$ make

Then run 'make install' to install to the default locations under /usr/local.
The PREFIX environment variable may be set to specify an alternative
installation location:

    $ export PREFIX=/opt		# defaults to /usr/local
    $ sudo make install

Quick start ====================================================================

A simple ~/.fdm.conf file for a single user fetching from POP3, POP3S and IMAP
accounts and delivering to one maildir may look similar to:

	# An action to save to the maildir ~/mail/inbox.
	action "inbox" maildir "%h/mail/inbox"

	# An action to drop unwanted mail.
	action "drop" drop
	
	# Accounts: POP3, POP3S and IMAP. Note the double escaping of the '\'
	# character in the password. If the port is omitted, the default
	# ("pop3", "pop3s", "imap" or "imaps" in the services(5) db) is used.
	account "pop3" pop3 server "my.pop3.server"
		user "my-username" pass "my-password-with-a-\\-in-it"
	account "pop3s" pop3 server "pop.googlemail.com" port 995
		user "my-account@gmail.com" pass "my-password"
	# If the 'folder "my-folder"' argument is omitted, fdm will fetch mail
	# from the inbox.
	account "imap" imap server "my.imap.server"
		user "my-username" pass "my-pasword" folder "my-folder"
	
	# Discard mail from Bob Idiot. Note that the regexp is an extended 
	# regexp, and case-insensitive by default.
	match "From:.*bob@idiot\\.net" action "drop"

	# Match all other mail and deliver using the 'inbox' action.
	match all action "inbox"

A simple initial configuration file without filtering, perhaps to replace
fetchmail or getmail delivering to maildrop, may look similar to:

	# Action to pipe directly to maildrop.
	action "maildrop" pipe "/usr/local/bin/maildrop"

	# Account definitions.
	account ....

	# Send all mail to maildrop.
	match all action "maildrop"

To run fdm every half hour from cron, add something like this:

*/30    *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/fdm -l fetch

See the fdm.conf(5) man page or the rest of this manual for more detail of the
configuration file format.

The configuration file =========================================================

fdm is controlled by its configuration file. It first searches for a .fdm.conf
file in the invoking user's home directory. If that fails, fdm attempts to use
/etc/fdm.conf. The configuration file may also be specified using the '-f'
command line option, see the section on that subject below.

This section gives an overview of the configuration file syntax. Further
details of syntax, and specific keywords, are covered in later sections.

The configuration file has the following general rules:

- Keywords are specified as unadorned lowercase words: match, action, all.
- Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("). Double quotes may be enclosed in
  strings by escaping them using the backslash character (\). Backslashes must
  also be escaped ("\\") - this applies to all strings, including regexps and
  passwords.
- Comments are prefixed by the hash character (#) and continue to the end of
  the line.
- Whitespace is largely ignored. Lines may generarally be split, concatenated
  or indented as preferred.

Definition/option lines generally follow the following basic form:

	<keyword> <name or command> <parameters>

Example lines that may appear in a configuration file are:
	
	# This is a comment.

	set lock-types flock

	account "stdin" disabled stdin

	action "strip-full-disclosure" rewrite
		"sed 's/Subject:\\(.*\\)\\[Full-disclosure\\]/Subject:\\1/'"

	match "^X-Mailing-List:.*linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org" in headers
		or "^(To:|Cc:):.*@vger.kernel.org" in headers
		action "linux-kernel"

Including other files ----------------------------------------------------------

The fdm configuration may be split into several files. Additional files may
be referenced using the 'include' keyword:

	include "my-include-file.conf"

	include	"/etc/fdm.d/shared-conf-1.conf"

Macros -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Macros may be defined and used in the configuration file. fdm makes a
distinction between macros which may hold a number (numeric macros) and
those that hold a string (string macros). Numeric macros are prefixed with
the percentage sign (%) and string by the dollar sign ($). Macros are 
defined using the equals operator (=):

	%nummacro = 123

	$strmacro = "a string"

Macros may then be referenced in either a standalone fashion anywhere a string
or number is expected, depending on the type of macro:

	$myfile = "a-file"
	include $myfile

	%theage = 12
	match age < %theage action "old-mail"

Or embedded in a string by enclosing the macro name in {}s:

	$myfile2 = "a-file2"
	include "/etc/${myfile}"

	%anum = 57
	include "/etc/file-number-%{anum}"

Invoking fdm ===================================================================

fdm may be invoked manually from the command line or regularly using a program
such as cron(8).

Command-line arguments ---------------------------------------------------------

The fdm binary has the following synopsis:

fdm [-klmnv] [-f conffile] [-u user] [-a account] [-x account] [fetch | poll]

The meaning of the flags are covered in the fdm(1) man page, but a brief
description is given below. The flags are also mentioned at relavent points 
in the rest of this document.

Flag	Meaning
-k 	Keep all mail (do not delete it from the server). This is useful for
	testing delivery rules without risking mailing ending up permanently
	in the wrong place.
-l	Log to syslog(3) using the 'mail' facility rather than outputting to
	stderr.
-m	Ignore the lock file.
-n	Run a syntax check on the configuration file and exit without fetch ing
	any mail.
-v	Print verbose debugging output. This option may be specified multiple
	times for increasing levels of verbosity. Useful levels are -vv to
	display the result of parsing the configuration file, and -vvvv to copy
	all traffic to and from POP3 or IMAP servers to stdout (note that -l
	disables this behaviour).
-f conffile
	Specify the path of the configuration file.
-u user	
	Use 'user' as the default user for delivering mail when started as
	root.
-a account
	Process only accounts with a name matching the given pattern. Note that
	fnmatch(3) wildcards may be used to match multiple accounts with one
	option, and that the option may be specified multiple times.
-x account
	Process all accounts except those that match the given patteen. Again,
	fnmatch(3) wildcards may be used, and the -x option may be specified
	multiple times.

If -n is not specified, the flags must be followed by one of the keywords
'fetch' or 'poll'. The 'fetch' keyword will fetch and deliver mail, the 'poll'
keyword print an indication of how many mails are present in each account.
'fetch' or 'poll' may be abbreviated.

Examples:

	$ fdm -v poll

	$ fdm -vvnf /etc/my-fdm.conf

	$ fdm -lm -a pop3\* fetch

	$ fdm -x stdinacct fetch
	
	# fdm -u nicholas -vv f

Running from cron --------------------------------------------------------------

To fetch mail regularly, fdm must be run from cron. This line in a crontab(5)
will run fdm every 30 minutes:

*/30   *      *      *      *      /usr/local/bin/fdm -l fetch

The '-l' option sends fdm's output to syslog(3) rather than having cron mail
it. If you want to keep a closer eye, adding '-v' options and removing '-l'
will have debugging output mailed by cron, or, using a line such as:

*/30   *      *      *      *      fdm -vvvv fetch >>/home/user/.fdm.log 2>&1

Will append extremely verbose fdm output to the ~/.fdm.log file. Note that this
log file can become pretty large, so another cronjob may be required to remove
it occasionally!

The lock file ------------------------------------------------------------------

fdm makes use of a lock file to prevent two instances running simultaneously.
By default, this lock file is .fdm.lock in the home directory of the user who
runs fdm, or /var/db/fdm.lock for root. This default may be overridden in
the configuration file with the 'set lock-file' command:

	set lock-file "/path/to/my/lock-file"

Or disabled altogether by being set to the empty string:

	set lock-file ""

The '-m' command-line option may be used to force fdm to ignore the lock file
and run regardless of its existence and without attempting to create it.

Testing and debugging ----------------------------------------------------------

fdm has some features to assist with testing and debugging a ruleset:

The '-n' command line option. This is particularly useful in conjunction with
'-vv', for example:

	$ cat test.conf
	account "pop3" pop3 server "s" user "u" pass "p"
	action "rw" rewrite "sed 's/\\(Subject:.*\\)\\[Crap\\]/\1/'"
	action "mbox" mbox "%h/INBOX"
	match all actions { "rw" "mbox" }
	$ fdm -vvnf test.conf
	version is: fdm 0.6 (20061204-1433)
	starting at: Tue Dec  5 15:45:41 2006
	user is: nicholas, home is: /home2/nicholas
	loading configuration from test.conf
	added account: name=pop3 fetch=pop3 server "s" port pop3 user "u"
	added action: name=rw deliver=rewrite "sed 's/\(Subject:.*\)\[Crap\]/1/'"
	added action: name=mbox deliver=mbox "%h/INBOX"
	finished file test.conf
	added rule: actions="rw" "mbox" matches=all
	configuration loaded
	locking using: flock 
	headers are: "to" "cc"
	domains are: "yelena"
	using tmp directory: /tmp

Looking at the output, the parsed strings used by fdm can be seen, and it is
possible to spot that an escape character has been missed in the command.

The 'k' command line option (and the 'keep' keywords on actions and accounts,
covered later) prevent fdm from deleting any mail after delivery. This may be
used to perform any number of test deliveries without risk of losing mail.

Fetching mail ==================================================================

fdm fetches mail from a set of 'accounts', defined using the 'account'
keyword. Each account has a name, a type, a number of account specific
parameters and a couple of optional flags. The general form is:

	account <name> [disabled] <type> [<parameters>] [keep]

The <name> item is a string by which the account is referred in filtering
rules, log output and for the '-a' and '-x' command line options.

If the optional 'disabled' keyword is present, fdm ignores the account unless
it is specified on the command-line using the '-a' flag.

The optional 'keep' keyword instructs fdm to keep all mail from this account
(not delete it from the server) regardless of the result of the filtering
rules.

The <type> item may be one of: 'pop3', 'pop3s', 'imap', 'imaps', 'stdin',
'maildir' or 'maildirs'.

POP3 and POP3S -----------------------------------------------------------------

Mail may be fetched from a POP3 account. A POP3 account is defined by
specifying the following parameters: the server host and optionally port, and
the user name and password. If the port is not specified, the default port
('pop3' in the services(5) database) is used. Examples of such an account
definition are:

	account "pop3acct" pop3 server "pop.isp.com" user "bob" pass "pass"
	
	account "gmx" pop3 server "pop.gmx.net" port 110 user "jim" pass "pass"

	account "acct" pop3 server "10.0.0.1" port "pop3"
		user "nicholas" pass "my-password" keep

	account "lycos" disabled pop3 server $localserver port 10110
		user "bob@lycos.co.uk" pass "password"

Note that the server string is enclosed in double quotes even if it is an IP,
and don't forget to escape any " and \ characters in passwords!

POP3S is specified in exactly the same way, except using the 'pop3s' keyword
for the type, and the default port is 'pop3s' rather than 'pop3':

	account "pop3sacct" pop3s server "pop.isp.com" user "bob" pass "pass"

IMAP and IMAPS -----------------------------------------------------------------

IMAP and IMAPS accounts are defined using exactly the same syntax as for POP3
and POP3S, aside from using the 'imap' or 'imaps' keywords and that the default
port is 'imap' or 'imaps'. There is also an additional, optional 'folder'
option to specify the folder from which mail should be fetched. If omitted,
the folder defaults to the inbox.

Note that with IMAP and IMAPS, mail is still removed from the server unless the
'keep' option is given, or the '-k' command line option used.

Examples of IMAP and IMAPS accounts include:

	account "imapacct" imap server "imap.server.ca" user "bob" pass "pass"

	account "oldimap" disabled imaps server "192.168.0.1" port 10993
		user "nicholas" pass "pass" folder "Saved"

	account "workspam" disabled imap server "my-work.ath.cx"
		user "Nicholas" pass "pass" folder "Junk"

Stdin and local mail -----------------------------------------------------------

fdm may be configured to fetch mail from stdin, by specifying an account of
type 'stdin', for example:

	account "stdin" disabled stdin

This is most useful to have fdm behave as a mail delivery agent. To configure
it for single-user use with sendmail, the simplest method it to add:

	"|/usr/local/bin/fdm -m -a stdin fetch"

To the user's ~/.forward file (including the double quotes). Note the use of
'-m' to prevent stdin delivery from interfering with any normal cronjob, and
'-a' to specify that only the disabled "stdin" account should be fetched.

From maildirs ------------------------------------------------------------------

Fetching from maildirs allows fdm to be used to filter mail on the local
machine. This is covered more detail in a later section on archiving and
searching.

Maildir accounts are specified as follows:

	account "mymaildir" maildir "/path/to/dir"

	account "mymaildirs" maildirs { "/path/to/dir1" "/path/to/dir2" }

Frequently asked questions =====================================================

Why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two main reasons: 

1. I didn't like the existing tools. I'm not going to do my fetchmail rant
   since getmail's Charles Cazabon has done his own in greater detail here:

	http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/faq.html#faq-about-why
  
   I'll also spare you my procmail rant, but suffice to say the syntax is 
   abysmal. getmail and maildrop I was less unhappy with overall, but I was
   not really comfortable with their configuration file formats. Plus getmail
   always seemed very slow. And there is reason 2...

2. I disliked the fact that as a home user with a relatively simple setup I
   had to have five programs to deal with mail: sendmail, fetchmail, procmail,
   archivemail, mutt; all with different, variously broken configuration file
   syntaxes, and weird quirks. I now have three programs: sendmail, fdm and
   mutt, and fewer weird configurations to learn and potential problems.

Why doesn't fdm run as a daemon? -----------------------------------------------

Because that is what cron is for: it comes as standard with all sensible
operating systems, and by using it I avoid a lot of code to deal with signals,
configuration reload, extra configuration options and general other crap
related to running all the time. Daemonising is for servers, for stuff that
needs to run periodically, use cron.

Why does fdm fork child processes when not running as root? --------------------

Because one design is much cleaner and easier to work with than two. And it
has a negligable practical effect on performance in any case.

Why do I have to escape \s in regexps and other strings? I hates it. -----------

Because otherwise you couldn't include a literal " in the string. It hasn't
really bothered me enough yet to do it, but allowing use of ' to avoid
escaping is on the todo list.
