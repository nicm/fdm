<B>NAME</B>
     <B>fdm </B>- fetch and deliver mail

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
     <B>fdm </B>[<B>-lmnv</B>] [<B>-f </B><I>conffile</I>] [<B>-u </B><I>user</I>] [<B>-a </B><I>account</I>] [<B>-x </B><I>account</I>] [<I>fetch </I>|
         <I>poll</I>]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     The <B>fdm </B>program fetches mail from a POP3 or IMAP server or from <I>stdin </I>and
     delivers it based on a ruleset in the configuration file.

     The options are as follows:

     <B>-a </B><I>name         </I>Process only the specified account. This option may ap-
                     pear multiple times. The account name may include shell
                     glob characters to match multiple accounts.

     <B>-f </B><I>conffile     </I>Specify the configuration file location. Default is
                     <I>~/fdm.conf</I>, or <I>/etc/fdm.conf </I>if it doesn't exist.

     <B>-l              </B>Log using syslog(3) rather than to <I>stderr</I>.

     <B>-m              </B>Ignore the lock file and run regardless of other in-
                     stances of <B>fdm</B>.

     <B>-n              </B>Do not process any accounts, just verify the configura-
                     tion file syntax and exit.

     <B>-u </B><I>user         </I>Specify the default user for delivery. This overrides the
                     <B>default-user </B>option in the configuration file.

     <B>-v              </B>Request verbose logging. This option may be specified
                     multiple times.

     <B>-x </B><I>name         </I>Exclude the named account. Multiple <B>-x </B>options may be
                     specified. As with <B>-a</B>, shell glob characters may be used.

     <I>fetch </I>| <I>poll    </I>The <I>fetch </I>command instructs <B>fdm </B>to fetch and deliver mes-
                     sages. The <I>poll </I>command polls the accounts in the config-
                     uration file and reports a message count for each.

<B>LOCAL MAIL WITH SENDMAIL</B>
     <B>fdm </B>can be used to deliver local mail from sendmail(8) by making use of
     .forward files. An account fetching mail from <I>stdin </I>should be specified
     in the user's <I>~/.fdm.conf </I>file,

           account "stdinacct" stdin

     and the user's <I>~/.forward </I>file should be set to contain something like
     (including quotation marks):

           "|/usr/local/bin/fdm -l -a stdinacct fetch"

     sendmail(8) will then invoke <B>fdm </B>to deliver mail and <B>fdm </B>will pass it
     through any filtering rules as normal.

FDM.CONF(5)               OpenBSD Programmer's Manual              FDM.CONF(5)

<B>NAME</B>
     <B>fdm.conf </B>- fdm configuration file

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
     This manual page describes the fdm(1) configuration file.  It defines
     <I>accounts </I>from which to fetch mail, a number of possible <I>actions </I>to take,
     and <I>rules </I>connecting a regexp with an action.  The file is parsed once
     from top to bottom, so action and account definitions must appear before
     they are referenced in a rule.  Rules are evaluated from first to last
     and (unless overridden by the <B>continue </B>keyword) evaluation stops at the
     first match.

     The file has the following format:

     Empty lines and lines beginning with the `#' character are ignored.

     Regexps and strings must be enclosed in double quotes.  Special charac-
     ters in regexps and strings must be escaped.  Note that this may mean
     double-escaping in regexps.

     Possible commands are covered in the following sections.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
     Options are configured using the <B>set </B>command.  It may be followed by the
     following options, one per command:

     <B>maximum-size </B><I>size</I>
             This is used to set the maximum size of a mail.  Mails larger
             than this limit are dropped and, if applicable, not deleted from
             the server.

             The size may be specified as a plain number in bytes or with a
             suffix of `K' for kilobytes, `M' for megabytes or `G' for giga-
             bytes.  The default is one gigabyte.

     <B>delete-oversized</B>
             If this option is specified, fdm(1) attempts to delete messages
             which exceed <B>maximum-size</B>, and continue.  If it is not specified,
             oversize messages are a fatal error and cause fdm(1) to abort.

     <B>allow-multiple</B>
             If this option is specified, fdm(1) does not attempt to create a
             lock file and allows multiple instances to run simultaneously.

     <B>lock-file </B><I>path</I>
             This sets an alternative lock file. The default is <I>~/.fdm.lock</I>
             for non-root users and <I>/var/db/fdm.lock </I>for root.

     <B>default-user </B><I>user</I>
             This sets the default user to change to before delivering mail,
             if fdm(1) is running as root and no alternative user is specified
             as part of the action or rule.  This option may be override with
             the <B>-u </B>switch on the command line.  A default user must be given
             if running as root.

     <B>lock-types </B><I>type ...</I>
             This specifies the locks to be used for mbox locking.  Possible
             types are <I>fcntl</I>, <I>flock</I>, and <I>dotlock</I>.  The <I>flock </I>and <I>fcntl </I>types
             are mutually exclusive.  The default is <I>flock</I>.

     <B>domain </B><I>domain </I>| <B>domains </B>{ <I>domain ... </I>}
             This specifies the domains to be used when looking for users with
             the <B>from-headers </B>keyword.  The default is the computer's host-
             name.

     <B>header </B><I>header </I>| <B>headers </B>{ <I>header ... </I>}
             This allows the headers to be examined when looking for users to
             be set.  The default is to look only at the "From" and "Cc" head-
             ers.  The headers are case-insensitive.

     <B>proxy </B><I>url</I>
             This instructs fdm(1) to proxy all connections through <I>url</I>.  HTTP
             and SOCKS5 proxies are supported at present (URLs of the form
             <I>http://host[:port] or socks://[user:pass@]host[:port])</I>.  No au-
             thentication is supported for HTTP.  This option may be overrid-
             den by an <I>http_proxy </I>variable in the environment.

<B>INCLUDING FILES</B>
     Further configuration files may be including using the <B>include </B>command:

     <B>include </B><I>path</I>

     The file to include is searched for first as an absolute path and then
     relative to the directory containing the main configuration file.

<B>ACCOUNTS</B>
     The <B>account </B>command is used to instruct fdm(1) to fetch mail from an ac-
     count.  The syntax is:

     <B>account </B><I>name </I>[<B>disabled</B>] <I>type </I>[<I>args</I>]

     The <I>name </I>argument is a string specifying a name for the account.  The
     <B>disabled </B>keyword instructs fdm(1) to ignore this account unless it is ex-
     plicitly enabled with a <B>-a </B>option on the command line.  Supported account
     types and arguments are:

     <B>stdin   </B>This account type reads mail from <I>stdin</I>, if it is connected to a
             pipe.  This may be used to deliver mail from sendmail(8), see
             fdm(1) for details.

     <B>pop3 server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] <B>user </B><I>user <B></I>pass </B><I>pass</I>

     <B>pop3s server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] <B>user </B><I>user <B></I>pass </B><I>pass</I>
             These statements define a POP3 or POP3S account.  The <I>host</I>, <I>user</I>
             and <I>pass </I>arguments must be strings.  The port option may be ei-
             ther a string which will be looked up in the services(5)
             database, or a number.  If it is omitted, the default port (143
             for POP3, 993 for POP3S) is used.

     <B>imap server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] <B>user </B><I>user <B></I>pass </B><I>pass </I>[<B>folder </B><I>name</I>]

     <B>imaps server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] <B>user </B><I>user <B></I>pass </B><I>pass </I>[<B>folder </B><I>name</I>]
             These define an IMAP or IMAPS account.  The parameters are as for
             a POP3 or POP3 account, aside from the additional <B>folder </B>option
             which allows the folder name to be specified (the default is to
             fetch from the inbox).

<B>ACTIONS</B>
     The <B>action </B>command is used to define actions.  These may be specified by
     name in rules (see below) to perform some action on a mail.  The syntax
     is:

     <B>action </B><I>name </I>[<I>users</I>] <I>action</I>

     The <I>name </I>is a string defining a name for the action.  The optional <I>users</I>
     argument has the following form:

     <B>user </B><I>user </I>| <B>users </B>{ <I>user ... </I>} | <B>user from-headers</B>

     The first two options specify a user or list of users as which the mail
     should be delivered.  If <B>user from-headers </B>is specified, fdm(1) attempts
     to find the users from the mail headers, using the values of the <B>headers</B>
     and <B>domains </B>options.  If no headers are specified, or fdm(1) fails to
     find any valid users in the headers, the default user (set with <B>set</B>
     <B>default-user</B>) is used.  An action's user setting may be overridden in the
     matching rule.  This keyword has no effect if fdm(1) is run as non-root.

     The possible values for <I>action </I>are listed below.  In actions for which a
     <I>command </I>or <I>path </I>is specified, the following substitutions are made before
     it is used: <I>%a </I>is replaced by the account name, <I>%h </I>by the current user's
     home directory, <I>%t </I>by the name of the current action, <I>%u </I>by the current
     user's login name and <I>%n </I>by the UID.

     <B>drop    </B>Discard the mail.

     <B>maildir </B><I>path</I>
             Save the mail to the maildir specified by <I>path</I>.

     <B>mbox </B><I>path</I>
             Append the mail to the mbox at <I>path</I>.

     <B>pipe </B><I>command</I>
             Pipe the entire mail to <I>command</I>.

     <B>write </B><I>path</I>
             Write the mail to <I>path</I>.

     <B>append </B><I>path</I>
             Append the mail to <I>path</I>.

     <B>smtp server </B><I>host </I>[<B>port </B><I>port</I>] [<B>to </B><I>to</I>]
             Connect to an SMTP server and attempt to deliver the mail to it.
             If <I>to </I>is specified, it is passed to the server in the RCPT TO
             command.  If not, the current user and host names are used.

     <B>rewrite </B><I>command</I>
             Pipe the entire mail through <I>command </I>to generate a new mail.  The
             modified mail is kept only within the rule the action appears, so
             it will be used only by subsequent actions in the same rule and
             not by actions in further rules.  This type of action does not
             work when running as root (although the command will be executed
             the mail will remain unchanged).  An example of the <B>rewrite </B>ac-
             tion is:

                   action "cat" pipe "cat"
                   action "rewrite" rewrite "sed 's/bob/fred/g'"
                   # this rule will rewrite the message and then cat it
                   match all actions { "rewrite" "cat" } continue
                   # this rule will cat the original message
                   match all action "cat"

<B>RULES</B>
     Rules are specified using the <B>match </B>keyword.  It has the following basic
     form:

     <B>match </B><I>conditions </I>[<I>accounts</I>] [<I>users</I>] <I>actions </I>[<B>continue</B>]

     The <I>condition </I>argument may be one of:

     <B>all     </B>Matches all mail.

     <B>matched</B>
             Matches only mail that has matched a previous rule and been
             passed on with <B>continue</B>.

     <B>unmatched</B>
             The opposite of <B>matched</B>: matches only mails which have matched no
             previous rules.

     [<B>not</B>] [<B>case</B>] <I>regexp </I>[<B>in headers </B>| <B>in body</B>] [<B>and </B>| <B>or </B><I>...</I>]
             Specifies a list of regexps against which each mail should be
             matched.  The regexp matches may be restricted to either the
             headers or body of the message by specifying either <B>in headers </B>or
             <B>in body</B>.  If the <B>not </B>keyword is specified, the sense of the reg-
             exp match is inverted, so the rule will apply to mails only where
             the regexp does <I>not </I>match.  The <B>case </B>keyword forces the regexp to
             be matched case-sensitively: the default is case-insensitive
             matching.  Multiple regexps may be specified by chaining them
             with <B>and </B>or <B>or </B>keywords.  The regexps are matched from left to
             right.

     The optional <I>users </I>argument has the same syntax as for an <B>action </B>defini-
     tion.  A rule's user list overrides any users given as part of the ac-
     tions.

     Both the <I>accounts </I>and <I>actions </I>parts consist either of a single name or a
     list of names enclosed in braces:

     <B>account </B><I>name </I>| <B>accounts </B>{ <I>name ... </I>}

     <B>action </B><I>name </I>| <B>actions </B>{ <I>name ... </I>}

     The <I>accounts </I>list is used to limit rules to matching mail within a set of
     accounts, and the <I>actions </I>list specifies the actions to perform when the
     rule matches a mail.  The account names may include shell glob wildcards
     to match multiple accounts, as with the <B>-a </B>and <B>-x </B>command line options.
     The actions are performed from left to right in the order they are speci-
     fied in the rule definition.

     If the <B>continue </B>keyword is present, evaluation will not stop if this rule
     is matched.  Instead, fdm(1) will continue to match further rules after
     performing any actions for this rule.
