.Sh NAME
.Nm fdm.conf
.Nd "fdm configuration file"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the
.Xr fdm 1
configuration file.
It defines
.Em accounts
from which to fetch mail, a number of possible
.Em actions
to take, and
.Em rules
connecting a regexp with an action.
The file is parsed once from top to bottom, so action and account
definitions must appear before they are referenced in a rule.
Rules are evaluated from first to last and (unless overridden by the
.Ic continue
keyword) evaluation stops at the first match.
.Pp
The file has the following format:
.Pp
Empty lines and lines beginning with the
.Sq #
character are ignored.
.Pp
Regexps and strings must be enclosed in double quotes.
Special characters in regexps and strings (including passwords) must be escaped.
Note that this may mean double-escaping in regexps.
.Pp
Possible commands are covered in the following sections.
.Sh OPTIONS
Options are configured using the
.Ic set
command.
It may be followed by the following options, one per command:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic maximum-size Ar size
This is used to set the maximum size of a mail.
Mails larger than this limit are dropped and, if applicable, not deleted from
the server.
.Pp
The size may be specified as a plain number in bytes or with a suffix of
.Ql K
for kilobytes,
.Ql M
for megabytes or
.Ql G
for gigabytes.
The default is 32 megabytes and the maximum is one gigabyte.
.It Ic delete-oversized
If this option is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
attempts to delete messages which exceed
.Ic maximum-size ,
and continue.
If it is not specified, oversize messages are a fatal error and cause
.Xr fdm 1
to abort.
.Pp
Note that
.Xr fdm 1
may have a number of messages queued (up to the
.Ic queue-high
setting, doubled for
rewrite, per account), so this setting and the
.Ic queue-high
option should be set
after consideration of the space available in the temporary folder and the
implications should
.Xr fdm 1
abort due to the space becoming full.
.It Ic queue-high Ar number
This sets the maximum number of messages
.Xr fdm 1
will hold simultaneously.
.Xr fdm 1
will attempt to process previously queued messages as the next is being
fetched.
Once this limit is reached, no further messages wil be fetched until
the number of messages held drops to the
.Ic queue-low
value.
.It Ic queue-low Ar number
This is the length to which the message queue must drop before fetching
continues after the
.Ic queue-high
limit has been reached.
.It Ic ignore-errors
If set,
.Nm
will continue to process mail if a delivery fails rather than aborting.
.It Ic allow-multiple
If this option is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
does not attempt to create a lock file and allows multiple instances to run
simultaneously.
.It Ic lock-file Ar path
This sets an alternative lock file.
The default is
.Pa ~/.fdm.lock
for non-root users and
.Pa /var/db/fdm.lock
for root.
.It Ic lock-timeout Ar time
Sets how long
.Nm
will try a lock file before giving up.
.It Ic lock-wait
If present,
.Nm
will wait for
.Ic lock-file
for
.Ic lock-timeout
rather than exiting immediately with an error.
.It Ic command-user Ar user
This specifies the user used to run
.Ic exec
and
.Ic pipe
actions.
By default it is the user who invoked fdm.
.It Ic default-user Ar user
This sets the default user to change to before delivering mail, if
.Xr fdm 1
is running as root and no alternative user is specified as part of the action
or rule.
This option may be overridden with the
.Fl u
switch on the command line.
A default user must be given if running as root.
.It Ic lookup-order Ar location ...
This specifies the order in which to do user lookup from left to right.
Possible types are
.Cm passwd
to use the
.Xr passwd 5
file, or
.Cm courier
to use Courier authlib (if support is compiled).
.It Ic lock-types Ar type Ar ...
This specifies the locks to be used for mbox locking.
Possible types are
.Cm fcntl ,
.Cm flock ,
and
.Cm dotlock .
The
.Cm flock
and
.Cm fcntl
types are mutually exclusive.
The default is
.Cm flock .
.It Ic proxy Ar url
This instructs
.Xr fdm 1
to proxy all connections through
.Ar url .
HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies are supported at present (URLs of the form
.Pf http:// Ar host Ns Op : Ns Ar port
or
.Pf socks:// Oo Ar user Ns : Ns Ar pass Ns @ Oc Ns host Ns Op : Ns Ar port ) .
No authentication is supported for HTTP.
.It Ic unmatched-mail Cm drop | keep
This option controls what
.Xr fdm 1
does with mail that reaches the end of the ruleset (mail that matches no rules
or matches only rules with the
.Ic continue
keyword).
.Cm drop
will cause such mail to be discarded, and
.Cm keep
will attempt to leave the mail on the server.
The default is to keep the mail and log a warning that it reached the end of
the ruleset.
.It Ic purge-after Ar count
The
.Ic purge-after
option makes
.Xr fdm 1
attempt to purge deleted mail from the server (if supported) after
.Ar count
mails have been retrieved.
This is useful on unreliable connections to limit the potential number of mails
refetched if the connetion drops, but note that it can incur a considerable
speed penalty.
.It Ic no-received
If this option is present,
.Xr fdm 1
will not insert a
.Sq Received
header into each mail.
.It Ic no-create
If this option is set,
.Xr fdm 1
will not attempt to create maildirs and mboxes or missing elements of their
paths.
.It Ic file-umask Ic user | Ar umask
This specifies the
.Xr umask 2
to use when creating files.
.Ic user
means to use the umask set when
.Xr fdm 1
is started, or
.Ar umask
may be specified as a three-digit octal number.
The default is 077.
.It Ic file-group Ic user | Ar group
This option allows the default group ownership of files and directories created
by
.Xr fdm 1
to be specified.
.Ar group
may be a group name string or a numeric gid.
If
.Ic user
is used, or this option does not appear in the configuration file,
.Xr fdm 1
does not attempt to set the group of new files and directories.
.It Ic timeout Ar time
This controls the maximum time to wait for a server to send data before closing
a connection.
The default is 900 seconds.
.It Ic verify-certificates
Instructs
.Xr fdm 1
to verify SSL certificates for all SSL connections.
.El
.Sh INCLUDING FILES
Further configuration files may be including using the
.Ic include
command:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic include Ar path
.El
.Pp
The file to include is searched for first as an absolute path and then relative
to the directory containing the main configuration file.
.Sh MACROS
Macros may be defined using the following syntax:
.Bl -item
.It
.Cm $ Ns Ar name Ic = Ar string
.It
.Cm % Ns Ar name Ic = Ar number
.El
.Pp
Macros are prefixed with $ to indicate a string value and % to indicate a
numeric value.
Once defined, a macro may be used in any place a string or number is expected.
Macros may be embedded in strings by surrounding their name (after the $ or %)
with {}s, like so:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
"abc ${mymacro} %{anothermacro} def"
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ic ifdef ,
.Ic ifndef
and
.Ic endif
keywords may be used to conditionally parse a section of the configuration file
depending on whether or not the macro given exists or does not exist.
.Ic ifdef
and
.Ic ifndef
blocks may be nested.
.Sh SHELL COMMANDS
The result of a shell command may be used at any point a string or number is
expected by wrapping it in $() or %().
If the former is used, the command result is used as a string; if the latter,
it is converted to an integer.
Shell commands are executed when the configuration file is parsed.
.Sh ACCOUNTS
The
.Ic account
command is used to instruct
.Xr fdm 1
to fetch mail from an account.
The syntax is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic account Ar name
.Op Ar users
.Op Ic disabled
.Ar type Op Ar args
.Op Ic keep
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar name
argument is a string specifying a name for the account.
The optional
.Ar users
argument has the following form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic user Ar user | Ic users
.Li {
.Ar user ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The first two options specify a user or list of users as which the mail should
be delivered when an action is executed.
If no users are specified, the default user (set with
.Ic set Ic default-user )
is used.
Users specified as part of the account definition may be overridden by similar
arguments to action definitions or on match rules.
If
.Xr fdm 1
is run as non-root, it will still execute any actions once for each user, but
will be unable to change to that user so the action will be executed multiple
times as the current user.
.Pp
The
.Ic disabled
keyword instructs
.Xr fdm 1
to ignore this account unless it is explicitly enabled with a
.Fl a
option on the command line.
If the
.Ic keep
keyword is specified, all mail collected from this account is kept (not
deleted) even if it matches a
.Ic drop
action.
.Pp
Supported account types and arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic stdin
This account type reads mail from
.Dv stdin ,
if it is connected to a pipe.
This may be used to deliver mail from
.Xr sendmail 8 ,
see
.Xr fdm 1
for details.
.It Xo Ic pop3 Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ic user Ar user
.Op Ic pass Ar pass
.Op Ar only
.Op Ic no-apop
.Op Ic no-uidl
.Op Ic starttls
.Xc
.It Xo Ic pop3s Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Op Ar only
.Op Ic no-apop
.Op Ic no-uidl
.Op Ic no-verify
.Op Ic insecure
.Xc
These statements define a POP3 or POP3S account.
The
.Ar userpass
element has the following form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Op Ic user Ar user
.Op Ic pass Ar pass
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar host ,
.Ar user
and
.Ar pass
arguments must be strings.
If the user or pass is not provided,
.Xr fdm 1
attempts to look it up in the
.Pa ~/.netrc
file (see
.Xr ftp 1
for details of the file format).
The port option may be either a string which will be looked up in the
.Xr services 5
database, or a number.
If it is omitted, the default port (110 for POP3, 995 for POP3S) is used.
.Pp
The
.Ar only
option takes the form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Op Ic new-only | Ic old-only
.Ic cache Ar path
.Xc
.El
.Pp
.Ic new-only
fetches only mail not previously fetched, and
.Ic old-only
is the inverse: it fetches only mail that has been fetched before.
The cache file is used to save the state of the POP3 mailbox.
The
.Ic no-apop
flag forces
.Xr fdm 1
not to use the POP3 APOP command for authentication, and the
.Ic no-verify
keyword instructs
.Xr fdm 1
to skip SSL certificate validation for this account.
The
.Ic no-uidl
keyword makes
.Xr fdm 1
not use the UIDL command to retrieve mails.
This is mainly useful for broken POP3 servers.
.Pp
.Ic starttls
attempts to use
.Em STARTTLS
after connection.
.Pp
.Ic insecure
allows the use of insecure protocols, which currently includes SSLv2, SSLv3
and TLS1.0.
.It Xo Ic pop3 Ic pipe Ar command
.Op Ar userpass
.Op Ar only
.Op Ic no-apop
.Xc
This account type uses the POP3 protocol piped through
.Ar command ,
such as
.Xr ssh 1 .
If the command produces any output to
.Dv stderr ,
it is logged.
For POP3 over a pipe, providing a user and password is not optional and it may
not be read from
.Pa ~/.netrc .
.It Xo Ic imap Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Op Ic folder Ar name
.Op Ar only
.Op Ic no-cram-md5
.Op Ic no-login
.Op Ic starttls
.Xc
.It Xo Ic imap Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Op Ic folders
.Li {
.Ar name ...
.Li }
.Op Ar only
.Xc
.It Xo Ic imaps Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Op Ar folders
.Op Ar only
.Op Ic no-verify
.Op Ic no-cram-md5
.Op Ic no-login
.Op Ic insecure
.Xc
These define an IMAP or IMAPS account.
The parameters are as for a POP3 or POP3S account, aside from the additional
.Ar folders
option which sets the name of the folder or folders to use (the default is to
fetch from the inbox). This has the form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic folder Ar name | Ic folders
.Li {
.Ar name Ar ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The default ports used are 143 for IMAP and 993 for IMAPS.
For IMAP, the
.Ar only
item consists only of one of the keywords
.Ic new-only
or
.Ic old-only
- a cache file is not required.
.Pp
Options
.Ic no-cram-md5
and
.Ic no-login
disable the given authentication method.
The default is to use CRAM-MD5 if it is available, or LOGIN otherwise.
.Pp
.Ic starttls
attempts to use
.Em STARTTLS
after connection.
.Pp
.Ic insecure
allows the use of insecure protocols, which currently includes SSLv2, SSLv3
and TLS1.0.
.It Xo Ic imap Ic pipe Ar command
.Op Ar userpass
.Op Ar folders
.Op Ar only
.Xc
As with
.Ic pop3
.Ic pipe ,
this account type uses the IMAP protocol piped through
.Ar command .
If the optional IMAP
.Ar user
and
.Ar pass
are supplied, they will be used if necessary, but if one is provided, both must
be \(en using
.Pa ~/.netrc
is not permitted.
.It Ic maildir Ar path
.It Xo Ic maildirs
.Li {
.Ar path ...
.Li }
.Xc
These account types instruct
.Xr fdm 1
to fetch mail from the maildir or maildirs specified.
This allows
.Xr fdm 1
to be used to filter mail, fetching from a maildir and deleting (dropping)
unwanted mail, or delivering mail to another maildir or to an mbox.
.Pp
Mail fetched from a maildir is tagged with a maildir tag containing
the basename of the mail file.
.It Ic mbox Ar path
.It Xo Ic mboxes
.Li {
.Ar path ...
.Li }
.Xc
These are similar to
.Ic maildir
and
.Ic maildirs ,
but cause
.Xr fdm 1
to fetch mail from an mbox or set of mboxes.
.Pp
Mail fetched from a mbox is tagged with a mbox tag containing the
basename of the mbox file.
.It Xo Ic nntp Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Ic group Ar group
.Ic cache Ar cache
.Xc
.It Xo Ic nntp Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Ic groups
.Li {
.Ar group ...
.Li }
.Ic cache Ar cache
.Xc
.It Xo Ic nntps Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Ic group Ar group
.Ic cache Ar cache
.Xc
.It Xo Ic nntps Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ar userpass
.Ic groups
.Li {
.Ar group ...
.Li }
.Ic cache Ar cache
.Xc
An NNTP account.
Articles are fetched from the specified group or groups and delivered.
The index and message-id of the last article fetched in each group is
saved in the specified cache file.
When
.Xr fdm 1
is run again, fetching begins at the cached article.
Note that the
.Ic keep
option is completely ignored for NNTP accounts \(en all mail is kept, and the
cache is always updated.
.El
.Sh TAGGING
As mail is processed by
.Xr fdm 1 ,
it is tagged with a number of name/value pairs.
Some tags are added automatically, and mail may also be tagged explicitly by
the user using the
.Ic tag
action.
Tags may be inserted in most strings in a similar manner to macros, except tags
are processed at runtime rather than as the configuration file is parsed.
A tag's value is inserted by wrapping its name in %[], for example:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It "abc%[account]def"
.It "%[hour]:%[minute]:%[second]"
.El
.Pp
The default tags also have a single-letter shorthand.
Including a nonexistent tag in a string is equivalent to including a tag with
an empty value, so "abc%[nonexistent]def" will be translated to "abcdef".
.Pp
The automatically added tags are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It account (%a)
The name of the account from which the mail was fetched.
.It home (%h)
The delivery user's home directory.
.It uid (%n)
The delivery user's uid.
.It action (%t)
The name of the last action executed for this mail.
.It user (%u)
The delivery user's username.
.It hour (%H)
The current hour (00\(en23).

The current day of the month (01\(en31).
.It month (%m)
The current month (01\(en12).
.It year (%y)
The current year.
.It year2
The current year as two digits.
.It dayofweek (%W)
The current day of the week (0\(en6, Sunday is 0).
.It dayofyear (%Y)
The current day of the year (001\(en366).
.It quarter (%Q)
The current quarter (1\(en4).
.It rfc822date
The current date in RFC822 format.
.It mail_hour
The hour from the mail's date header, if it exists and is valid, otherwise the
current time.
.It mail_minute
The minute from the mail's date header.
.It mail_second
The second from the mail's date header.
.It mail_day
The day from the mail's date header.
.It mail_month
The month from the mail's date header.
.It mail_year
The year from the mail's date header.
.It mail_year2
The same as two digits.
.It mail_dayofweek
The day of the week from the mail's date header.
.It mail_dayofyear
The day of the year from the mail's date header.
.It mail_quarter
The quarter (1\(en4) from the mail's date header.
.It mail_rfc822date
The mail's date in RFC822 format.
.It hostname
The local hostname.
.El
.Pp
In addition, the shorthand %% is replaced with a literal %, and %0 to %9 are
replaced with the result of any bracket expressions in the last regexp.
.Sh CACHES
.Xr fdm 1
can maintain a cache file with a set of user-defined strings.
In order to use caches,
.Xr fdm 1
must have been compiled with them enabled.
Caches are declared with the
.Ic cache
keyword:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic cache Ar path
.Op Ic expire Ar age
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar path
is the location of the cache file. If the
.Ic expire
keyword is specified, items in the cache are removed after they reach the age
specified.
.Ar age
may be given unadorned in seconds, or followed by one of the modifiers:
.Em seconds ,
.Em hours ,
.Em minutes ,
.Em days ,
.Em months
or
.Em years .
.Pp
Caches must be declared before they are used. Items are added to caches using
the
.Ic add-to-cache
action, removed using the
.Ic remove-from-cache
action, and searched for using the
.Ic in-cache
condition; see below for information on these.
.Sh ACTIONS
The
.Ic action
command is used to define actions.
These may be specified by name in rules (see below) to perform some action on a
mail.
The syntax is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic action Ar name Op Ar users
.Ar action
.Xc
.It Xo Ic action Ar name Op Ar users
.Li {
.Ar action ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar name
is a string defining a name for the action.
The
.Ar users
argument has the same form as for an account definition.
An action's user setting may be overridden in the matching rule.
.Pp
The possible values for
.Ar action
are listed below.
If multiple actions are specified they are executed once in the order specified,
for each user.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic drop
Discard the mail.
.It Ic keep
Keep the mail, do not remove it from the account.
.It Xo Ic tag Ar string
.Op Ic value Ar value
.Xc
This tags mail with
.Ar string ,
and optionally
.Ar value ,
which may be matched using the
.Ic tagged
or
.Ic string
conditions.
.It Xo Ic maildir Ar path
.Xc
Save the mail to the maildir specified by
.Ar path .
If the maildir or any part of its path does not exist, it is created, unless the
.Ic no-create
option is set.
.Pp
Mail delivered to a maildir is tagged with a mail_file tag containing the full
path of the mail file.
.It Xo Ic mbox Ar path Op Ic compress
.Xc
Append the mail to the mbox at
.Ar path .
If
.Ic compress
is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
will add
.Sq .gz
to
.Ar path
and attempt to write mail using
.Xr gzip 1
compression.
If the mbox or any part of its path does not exist, it is created, unless the
.Ic no-create
option is set.
.Pp
Mail delivered to an mbox is tagged with a mbox_file tag containing the path of
the mbox.
.It Xo Ic exec Ar command
.Xc
Execute
.Ar command .
.It Xo Ic pipe Ar command
.Xc
Pipe the mail to
.Ar command .
.Ic exec
and

.Xc
Write the mail to
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic append Ar path
.Xc
Append the mail to
.Ar path .
.It Xo Ic smtp Ic server Ar host
.Op Ic port Ar port
.Op Ic from Ar from
.Op Ic to Ar to
.Xc
Connect to an SMTP server and attempt to deliver the mail to it.
If
.Ar from
or
.Ar to
is specified, they are passed to the server in the MAIL FROM or RCPT TO
commands.
If not, the current user and host names are used.
.It Xo Ic rewrite Ar command
.Xc
Pipe the entire mail through
.Ar command
to generate a new mail and use that mail for any following actions or rules.
An example of the
.Ic rewrite
action is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
action "cat" pipe "cat"
action "rewrite" rewrite "sed 's/bob/fred/g'"
# this rule will rewrite the message
match all action "rewrite" continue
# this rule will cat the rewritten message
match all action "cat"
.Ed
.It Ic add-header Ar name Ic value Ar value
Add a header
.Ar name
with contents
.Ar value .
.It Ic remove-header Ar name
.It Xo Ic remove-headers
.Li {
.Ar name ...
.Li }
.Xc
Remove all occurances of headers matching the
.Xr fnmatch 3
pattern
.Ar name .
.It Ic stdout
Write the mail to
.Dv stdout .
.It Ic add-to-cache Ar path Ic key Ar key
This action adds the string
.Ar key
to the cache specified by
.Ar path .
If
.Ar key
already exists in the cache, it is replaced.
.It Ic remove-from-cache Ar path Ic key Ar key
Remove the string
.Ar key
from the cache
.Ar path ,
if a matching key is present.
.It Ic action Ar name
This invokes another named action.
A maximum of five actions may be called in a sequence.
.El
.Sh RULES
Rules are specified using the
.Ic match
keyword.
It has the following basic form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic match
.Ar condition
.Op Ic and | Ic or Ar condition ...
.Op Ar users
.Ar actions
.Op Ic continue
.Xc
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar condition
argument may be one of:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic all
Matches all mail.
.It Ic matched
Matches only mail that has matched a previous rule and been passed on with
.Ic continue .
.It Ic unmatched
The opposite of
.Ic matched :
matches only mails which have matched no previous rules.
.It Xo Ic account Ar name | Ic accounts
.Li {
.Ar name ...
.Li }
.Xc
Matches only mail fetched from the named account or accounts.
The account names may include shell glob wildcards to match multiple accounts,
as with the
.Fl a
and
.Fl x
command line options.
.It Ic tagged Ar string
Matches mails tagged with
.Ar string .
.It Xo Op Ic case
.Ar regexp
.Op Ic in Ic headers | Ic in body
.Xc
Specifies a regexp against which each mail should be matched.
The regexp matches may be restricted to either the headers or body of
the message by specifying either
.Ic in headers
or
.Ic in body .
The
.Ic case
keyword forces the regexp to be matched case-sensitively: the default is
case-insensitive matching.
.It Xo Ic exec Ar command
.Op Ic user Ar user
.Ic returns
.Pf ( Ar return code ,
.Ar stdout regexp )
.Xc
.It Xo Ic pipe Ar command
.Op Ic user Ar user
.Ic returns
.Pf ( Ar return code ,
.Op Ic case
.Ar stdout regexp )
.Xc
These two conditions execute a
.Ar command
and test its return value and output.
The
.Ar return code
argument is the numeric return code expected and
.Ar stdout regexp
is a regexp to be tested against the output of the command to
.Dv stdout .
Either of these two arguments may be omitted: if both are specified,
both must match for the condition to be true.
The
.Ic pipe
version will pipe the mail to the command's
.Dv stdin
when executing it.
If a user is specified,
.Xr fdm 1
will change to that user before executing the command, otherwise the
current user (or root if started as root) is used.
.It Xo Ic size
.Li <
.Ar number
.Xc
.It Xo Ic size
.Li >

.Ar time
.Xc
The
.Ic age
condition examines the mail's date header to determine its age, and matches if
the mail is older (>) or newer (<) than the time specified.
The time may be given as a simple number in seconds, or followed by the word
.Em seconds ,
.Em hours ,
.Em minutes ,
.Em days ,
.Em months
or
.Em years
to specify a time in different units.
.It Ic in-cache Ar path Ic key Ar key
This condition evaluates to true if the string
.Ar key
is in the cache at
.Ar path .

These conditions match if the mail possesses a number of attachments less
than, greater than, equal to or not equal to
.Ar number .
.It Xo Ic attachment Ic total-size
.Li <
.Ar size
.Xc
.It Xo Ic attachment Ic total-size
.Li >

.Xc
Matches if the total size of all attachments is smaller or larger than
.Ar size .
.It Xo Ic attachment Ic any-size
.Li <
.Ar size
.Xc
.It Xo Ic attachment Ic any-size
.Li >

.Xr fnmatch 3
wildcards may be used.
.El
.Pp
Multiple conditions may be chained together using the
.Ic and
or
.Ic or
keywords.
The conditions are tested from left to right.
Any condition may be prefixed by the
.Ic not
keyword to invert it.
.Pp
The optional
.Ar users
argument to the first form has the same syntax as for an
.Ic action
definition.
A rule's user list overrides any users given as part of the actions.
.Pp
The
.Ar actions
list specifies the actions to perform when the rule matches a mail.
It is either of a similar form:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic action Ar name | Ic actions
.Li {
.Ar name ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Pp
Or may specify a number of actions inline (lambda actions):
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic action Ar action
.It Xo Ic action
.Li {
.Ar action ...
.Li }
.Xc
.El
.Pp
In the latter case,
.Ar action
follows the same form as described in the ACTIONS section.
The actions are performed from first to last in the order they are specified in
the rule definition.
.Pp
If the
.Ic continue
keyword is present, evaluation will not stop if this rule is matched.
Instead,
.Xr fdm 1
will continue to match further rules after performing any actions for this rule.
.Sh NESTED RULES
Rules may be nested by specifying further rules in braces:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic match
.Ar condition
.Op Ic and | Ic or Ar condition ...
.Li {
.Xc
.It Ic match Ar ...
.It Li }
.El
.Pp
The inner rules will not be evaluated unless the outer one matches.
Rules may be multiply nested.
Note that the outer rule does not count as a match for the purposes of the
.Ic matched
and
.Ic unmatched
conditions.
